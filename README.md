Hello guys, this is privacy friendly analytics tool, Analytics Box for web written in go. It ensures user privacy but at the same time also provides key metrics that will ensure your business does good while keeping user privacy in mind.

**Important**: Analytics box now has a dashboard tailored to its use, it is not complete tho it lacks features like filters which are implemented on backend and is matter of time before they are made working in frontend.
